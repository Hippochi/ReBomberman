# Re:Bomberman

Re:Bomberman is a new take on an old game, adding a second layer of play to the game mode, creating a new and dynamic play-style that can be quite difficult to navigate. As the time passes more enemies spawn, survive as long as you can. Bombs drop on both sides at the same time, meaning you have to check where is safe on both sides of the screen.

## Installation

Download the build and run the .exe file in the builds directory (Code is openable through Unity or your favourite Text editor)


## Usage

The menu is mouse control, view controls and information on playing the game in the How to Play menu, controls are  WASD for player movement and Spacebar for dropping a bomb
